          <div id="main_content">
            <p>What is the best kept secret in international education? Yes, you guessed it. The high quality education in Canada. How does its educational system compare to international standards? Education in Canada has to make the grade by meeting its own rigorous governmental standards. This benchmark governs all Elementary, Secondary, and Post Seconday Institutions. As a result, Canadian educational institutions have earned an international reputation for excellence and are a great choice for students wishing to study overseas. </p>
            <p>Education in Canada has built in standards established by provincial governments, whose job it is to ensure that a quality curriculum is delivered. Although education is primarily within provinicial jurisdiction, it is funded and overseen by all three tiers of federal, provincial, and local governments. Each of the ten provinces in Canada is responsible for the writing of its curriculum and they monitor its delivery closely. Highly qualified educators write the curriculum in their field of expertise, keeping the subjects current while promoting sound educational practices. These educational standards govern all  levels of public education including the Elementary (Primary School), followed by Secondary (High School) and is inclusive of Post Secondary (University, College). </p>
            <p>Most Canadian schools begin with grade 1 through to grade twelve, and generally have 190 school days in the year starting from  early September to the end of June. In Canada, secondary schooling, is known as high school, école secondaire. or secondary school, depending on the province in which one resides. Education is compulsory up to the age of 16 in every province in Canada, except for Ontario and New Brunswick, where the compulsory ages are 18. Grade structure may vary somewhat within a province. In Quebec, for example, the typical high school term ends after Secondary V, (equivalent to grade eleven) when students who wish to pursue their studies at the university level, attend CEGEP (collèges d'enseignement général et professionnel) </p>
            <p>Canadian universities have earned an international reputation for excellence. The 89 Universities that are members of the Association of Universities and Colleges of Canada are located across the country, with institutions in every Canadian province. They offer a wide range of courses. Their faculty have recognized research and teaching strengths in areas such as sciences, computer sciences, business (including MBA programs) health sciences, law, ocean studies, natural resources, agriculture and many other fields.</p>
            <p>Special programs are often available to help first-year overseas students to improve their chances for success at university. Some offer for-credit courses aimed at integrating students to university life and studies. Many universities provide such assistance on an on-going basis throughout the academic year, with workshops in areas such as essay and exam writing, study and research skills. In addition, The International Student Office (ISO) helps students save lots of time and worries.  The staff of The ISO provide students with information about the programmes and services available such as: immigration regulations, cultural adaptation, working on campus, health insurance, academic support and referral, housing.</p>
            <p>In addition to universities, Canada's postsecondary system includes 175 community colleges, which respond to the training needs of business, industry and the public service, as well as the educational needs of vocationally oriented secondary school graduates. These colleges, also known as institutes of technology, university colleges or CEGEPS, historically offered diplomas and certificates rather than degrees. Today, some offer degrees themselves, and a number offer university transfer programs or provide programs jointly with neighbouring universities.</p>
            <p>A growing number of Canadian universities and colleges offer entrance scholarships to their institutions. Information about criteria and duration of scholarships from Canadian education institutions can be obtained directly through the financial aid offices on universities and colleges. A number of scholarships found in the websites below are eligible for Vietnamese students:</p>
